# AStar-Search
# 🌟 A* Search Algorithm Project

This project implements the **A\*** (A-star) search algorithm and compares it with **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** under different heuristic functions.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The A* algorithm is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, which efficiently finds the shortest path between two nodes using a combination of:
- **g(n)** = cost from start node to current node  
- **h(n)** = heuristic estimated cost from current node to goal node

It was implemented as part of a **Constraint Satisfaction & Search Algorithms** assignment.
